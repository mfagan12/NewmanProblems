# Solutions to some problems in Computational Physics

## Solutions by Michael Fagan

This repository contains the solutions to a collection of problems in 
*Computational Physics* by Mark Newman. Some of my goals in writing these
solutions:
- I aim for a balance of speed and readability, not shying away from using 
numpy, but trying to use pure (and Pythonic) Python wherever possible unless 
performance becomes an issue. 
- I will try to leverage Python's language features (like generators, type 
hinting, and comprehensions) as often as is reasonable. Many books in 
computational sciences and numerical analysis with Python avoid using these.
